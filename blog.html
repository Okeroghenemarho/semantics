                Learning markup language is not very hard. I have challenges and of
                course I get frustrated but I will wake up the next day and redo what
                I was stuck on and everything comes back and I feel fufilled.One
                incident that has to be my frustration highlight wass learning form action
                and not been. able to put in dates and age, <em>>sigh</em>, I almost cried.

                Basically,this blog is just encouraging those out there that feel
                learning is hard. <strong>Nothing is hard if you put your mind to it.</strong>
                Plus I'm pretty sure if I can do it,you can. When you decide to start, you
                can always talk to me about your journey. I will be very excited to listen!
